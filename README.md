## TO DO

For the top-down design layout, here’s what I’d include after the centered logo:

1. Hero Section (Zip Code Input & Location Detection)
   Below the centered logo, a tagline like:
   “Find Your Nearest Vodka Retailer” (Subtle, elegant text)
   A frosted glass input box for users to enter their zip code
   A “Use My Location” button (small GPS icon next to it)
2. Featured Store (Closest Store Highlighted)
   A large frosted glass card showcasing the closest store
   Store name (bold)
   Address
   Distance (e.g., "1.2 miles away")
   "View Details" button
3. Additional Closest Stores (Horizontal Scroll or List)
   Below the featured store, show the next three closest stores
   Each store in a smaller frosted glass card
   Store name
   Distance
   "More Info" button
4. Map View Button (Floating Action Button - FAB)
   A floating button on the bottom right corner with a map icon
   Clicking it switches the list view to interactive map view
5. Bottom Navigation (if needed for Multi-Page Experience)
   If the app has more features (e.g., saved stores, promotions), include a minimal bottom nav bar with icons for:
   Home (store locator)
   Map
   Favorites
   Settings
